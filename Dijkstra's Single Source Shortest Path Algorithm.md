# Ex. No: 18C - Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest Path Algorithm

## AIM:
To write a Python program for **Dijkstra's single source shortest path algorithm**.

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Initialize a `distance[]` array with infinity for all vertices except the source, which is set to `0`.  
Create a `sptSet[]` array (shortest path tree set) to keep track of vertices whose shortest distance from the source is finalized.

**Step 2**: Pick the vertex `u` with the minimum distance value from the set of vertices not yet processed.

**Step 3**: For every adjacent vertex `v` of the picked vertex `u`, if the current distance to `v` is greater than the distance to `u` plus the edge weight `(u, v)`, then update the distance of `v`.

**Step 4**: Mark the vertex `u` as processed in `sptSet`.

**Step 5**: Repeat Steps 2â€“4 until all vertices are processed.

**Step 6**: Print the shortest distances from the source to all other vertices.
