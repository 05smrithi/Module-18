# Ex. No: 18B - Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithm

## AIM:
To write a Python program for **Kruskal's algorithm** to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given connected, undirected, and weighted graph.

## ALGORITHM:

**Step 1**: Sort all the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights.

**Step 2**: Initialize the `parent[]` and `rank[]` arrays for each vertex to keep track of the disjoint sets.

**Step 3**: Iterate through the sorted edges and pick the smallest edge. Check whether including this edge will form a cycle using the union-find method:
- If the vertices of the edge belong to different sets, include it in the MST.
- Perform a union of these two sets.

**Step 4**: Repeat Step 3 until the MST contains exactly `V-1` edges.

**Step 5**: Print the edges included in the MST and the total minimum cost.
